# Dashboard with Admin Interface - To Do List

## Phase 1: Backend Setup & API Development (Flask)
- [X] Initialize Flask backend project (`dashboard_backend`).
- [X] Define database models for dashboard categories and items.
- [C] Implement CRUD API endpoints for categories (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- [X] Implement CRUD API endpoints for items within categories.
- [X] Set up basic authentication for admin API endpoints.
- [ ] Configure Flask app to serve React frontend (or handle CORS if separate).
- [ ] Test API endpoints thoroughly (e.g., using curl or Postman).

## Phase 2: Frontend - Admin Interface (React)
- [ ] Set up a new React project (or integrate into existing one) for the admin panel.
- [ ] Design UI for managing categories (listing, adding, editing, deleting).
- [ ] Design UI for managing items within categories (listing, adding, editing, deleting).
- [ ] Implement forms for creating/editing categories and items.
- [ ] Implement API calls from React admin interface to Flask backend.
- [ ] Add state management for admin data (e.g., using Context API or Zustand/Redux).
- [ ] Implement a login form for the admin interface.
- [ ] Style the admin interface for usability.

## Phase 3: Frontend - Public Dashboard (React)
- [ ] Modify the existing React dashboard to fetch data from the new Flask API instead of `data.ts`.
- [ ] Ensure the public dashboard still looks and functions as designed (animations, tooltips, etc.).

## Phase 4: Integration, Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Integrate frontend (admin and public dashboard) with the backend.
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire application (admin updates reflecting on public dashboard).
- [ ] Test responsiveness of both admin and public dashboards.
- [ ] Prepare for deployment (update `requirements.txt` for Flask, build React apps).
- [ ] Deploy the Flask backend.
- [ ] Deploy the React frontend(s).
- [ ] Provide user with access details for the admin interface and the updated public dashboard.

## Notes:
- Ensure secure handling of credentials and data.
- Maintain a modern and slick design for both interfaces.
